### 🌍 Creating technology with empathy and impact

From **social work to software**, I’m on a journey to combine empathy and technology to create solutions that make a real difference.

I bring a strong background in communication, human-centered thinking, and empathy — and I’m learning how to combine that with clean, intentional code.
